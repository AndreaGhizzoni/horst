"horst" is a scanning and analysis tool for wireless OLSR nodes in ad-hoc mode.

problem description: with the usual wireless tools like iwconfig and iwspy it is hard
to measure the received signal strength (or SNR) for each of the different nodes which
form an ad-hoc network. this information however is very important for setting up,
debugging and optimizing wireless OLSR mesh networks.

"horst" aims to fill this gap and lists the single nodes of an ad-hoc network
seperately including the signal strength (SNR) of the last received packet from each node.
this way you can see which nodes are part of a specific ad-hoc cell (BSSID), discover
problems with ad-hoc cell merging (a problem of many wlan drivers), which of the
nodes send OLSR packets, wether they use the link quality exension, how many neighbors
each node sees and the SNR of the last received packet of each station.

it uses the monitor mode including prism2 headers (for the signal strength information)
of the wlan cards and listens to all packets which come in the wireless interface.
these packets are scanned for OLSR traffic and summarized by the MAC address of the
sending node. [actually what it does is quite similar to kismet, and in might be a good
idea to include this functionality into kismet.]

it should work with any wlan card which can do monitor mode and which has prism2 headers
in monitor mode. but it has been tested only with the following wlan chipsets/drivers:
 * prism2 with hostap
 * atheros with madwifi-ng

you have to put your card in monitor mode and set the channel manually before you start
the tool:

1.) put card in monitor mode:
	hostap:
	# iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor

	madwifi-ng:
	# wlanconfig wlan0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode monitor

2.) enable prism headers in monitor mode
	hostap:
	# iwpriv wlan0 monitor_type 1
	or
	# prism2_param wlan0 monitor_type 1

	(madwifi-ng: prism headers are enabled by default)

3.) tune to a channel
	# ifconfig wlan0 up
	# iwconfig wlan0 channel 10

4.) start tool
	# ./horst
